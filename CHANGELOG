v0.6.1 (Unreleased)
- Stopped using LibXMLs Reader class as the basis for our reader.
  - We were getting too many segfaults (even 1 is too many!)
  - until we resolve it, reverted to manual string parsing
  - This is a fairly major regression of functionality. For 99% of files
    it won't matter, but for some corner cases it will. ie UTF-16 encoded
    files
  - Will also be noticeably slower
  - Hopefully only a short term fix, until I work out what is going on with
    libxml

v0.6.0 (18th March 2009)
